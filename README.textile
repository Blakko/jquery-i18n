h2. About

_jQuery-i18n_ is a jQuery plugin for doing client-side translations in javascript. It is based heavily on "javascript i18n that almost doesn’t suck":http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=100 by Marko Samastur, and is licensed under the "MIT license":http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php .

h2. Installation

You'll need to download the "jQuery library":http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery#Current_Release , and include it before jquery.i18n.js in your HTML source. See the _examples_ folder for examples.

h2. Usage

Before you can do any translation you have to initialise the plugin with a ‘dictionary’ (basically a property list mapping keys to their translations).

{% highlight javascript %}
var my_dictionary = { 
    "some text"  : "a translation",
    "some more text"  : "another translation"
}
$.i18n.setDictionary(my_dictionary);
{% endhighlight %}

Once you’ve initialised it with a dictionary, you can translate strings using the $.i18n._() function, for example:

{% highlight javascript %}
$('div#example').text($.i18n._('some text'));
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Building From Scratch

You can build the regular, un-minified version simply by running _ant_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ant
Buildfile: build.xml

jquery.i18n:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.i18n.js
     [echo] ./jquery.i18n.js built.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 0 seconds
{% endhighlight %}

Before you can build the minified version yourself, you'll need to download the "Google Closure Compiler":http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip and put it in a folder called _build_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ wget http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/files/compiler-latest.zip
$ unzip compiler-latest.zip
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have the compiler, you can build the minified version by running _ant min_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ant min
Buildfile: build.xml

jquery.i18n:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.i18n.js
     [echo] ./jquery.i18n.js built.

min:
     [echo] Building ./jquery.i18n.min.js
    [apply] Applied java to 1 file and 0 directories.
   [delete] Deleting: /Users/dave/Documents/Code/jquery/jquery-i18n/tmpmin
     [echo] ./jquery.i18n.min.js built.
